poppler-data (0.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Drop below fifteen "*-RKSJ-H CMap resources"
   - CNS01-RKSJ-H, CNS02-RKSJ-H, CNS03-RKSJ-H, CNS04-RKSJ-H, CNS05-RKSJ-H, 
     CNS06-RKSJ-H, CNS07-RKSJ-H, CNS15-RKSJ-H, GB-RKSJ-H, GBT-RKSJ-H, HK-RKSJ-H,
     Hojo-RKSJ-H, KSC-RKSJ-H, KSC2-RKSJ-H and TCVN-RKSJ-H

  Those files were included until 0.2.1, but were excluded from 0.3.0 by 
  upstream.
 
  Those were used for the production of "CJKV Information Processing" First 
  Edition and are obsolete and deprecated. 

  We can see any PDF files that was created with those resources without those
  files because application such as FrameMaker would change the encoding to 
  "Identity-H". And please note that not all RJSJ-H files were removed, for
  example, mostly used 83pv-RKSJ-H and 90ms-RKSJ-H are included to this 
  package (Thanks you for the explanation, Ken Lunde (Adobe Corp.)).

  Dropped files may be released under FLOSS license in some day, but I don't 
  know when it comes. If anyone has any trouble with this change, please 
  report a bug to Debian BTS.
